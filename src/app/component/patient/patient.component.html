          <h2>Patient Portal</h2>
          <p>This project involves the creation of a repository of themes that are dynamically stored. Users can select different colors that can change the look of a website and save it onto their profile. A profileâ€™s color themes are stored onto a database server and can be retrieved, updated, and applied to the website. Frontend frameworks such as Bootstrap and AngularJS were utilized to format and make the website dynamic. The first section of the project involves creating a LESS generator, which stores the color values that the user selects as LESS variables and exports it into a LESS file that will be compiled into a CSS file. The second section of the project is composed of creating a website that will take the CSS file and apply it to the website for demonstration purposes. This project will showcase how easily and freely users can customize the appearance of the website.</p>
